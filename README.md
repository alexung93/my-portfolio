## Portfolio

A small personal project to showcase my experience and journey.

1.  **Installation**

First set up your Gatsby(https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) environment.

Use the npm command to install the dependencies
```sh
npm install 
```
To host the website locally you can use the command
```sh
gatsby develop
```

The previous command should have worked if not, set up the gatsby cli
```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

To build the website for production
```sh
gatsby build
```

To serve the production site use
```sh
gatsby serve
```

To read more about the commands that you can use with Gatsby go here(https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/)

1.  **Roadmap**
- Make the application mobile-friendly
- Add better documentation.
- Add better practices of React.
- Use GatsbyJS features more.

1. **Forking**
If you want to fork this repo, please contact me first. I wouldn't mind depending on the use case of the code. Thank you for understanding.
