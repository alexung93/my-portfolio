# Portfolio

A small personal project to showcase my experience and journey.

## Installation

First set up your [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) environment.

Use the npm command to install the dependencies
```sh
npm install 
```
To host the website locally you can use the command
```sh
gatsby develop
```

The previous command should have worked if not, set up the gatsby cli
```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

To build the website for production
```sh
gatsby build
```

To serve the production site use
```sh
gatsby serve
```

To read more about the commands that you can use with Gatsby go [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/).

## Workflow
You can take a look at these articles/posts, I will be trying my best to implement features/hotfixes in this fashion, as it is good practice and keeps clean code. [Github Workflow](https://medium.com/@patrickporto/4-branching-workflows-for-git-30d0aaee7bf).

Here is more information about squashing before committing, [squashing commits](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/263164/why-squash-git-commits-for-pull-requests).

- Before creating a new branch, make sure that your code is up to date with the master branch before updating code

- Create a new branch for features and hotfixes seperately and merge it into the dev branch. I.E
```sh
git checkout -b feature-x
```
- After the feature/hotfix is ready for merging into the dev branch and have a collaborator review the merge

## Roadmap
- Make the application mobile-friendly
- Add better documentation.
- Add better practices of React.
- Use GatsbyJS features more.

## Forking
If you want to fork this repo, please contact me first. I wouldn't mind depending on the use case of the code. Thank you for understanding.

## Comments
Feel free to send me a message with constructive criticism or things that you think I should read to improve my site. Thank you!
