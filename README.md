# Portfolio

A small personal project to showcase my experience and journey.

###Installation

First set up your [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) environment.

Use the npm command to install the dependencies
```sh
npm install 
```
To host the website locally you can use the command
```sh
gatsby develop
```

The previous command should have worked if not, set up the gatsby cli
```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

To build the website for production
```sh
gatsby build
```

To serve the production site use
```sh
gatsby serve
```

To read more about the commands that you can use with Gatsby go [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/)

###Workflow
- Create a new branch for features and hotfixes seperately and merge it into the dev branch. I.E
```sh
git checkout -b feature-x
```
- After the feature/hotfix is ready for merging into the dev branch and have a collaborator review the merge

###Roadmap
- Make the application mobile-friendly
- Add better documentation.
- Add better practices of React.
- Use GatsbyJS features more.
